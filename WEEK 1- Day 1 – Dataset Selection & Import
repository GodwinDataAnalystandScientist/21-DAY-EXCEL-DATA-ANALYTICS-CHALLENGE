1.Dataset size and structure

The dataset contains 51,290 rows and 13 columns, indicating a fairly large transactional dataset suitable for sales or order-level analysis.

2,Data types need cleaning

All columns are currently stored as object (string) data types, including dates (Order Date, Ship Date) and numeric fields (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit).

These should be converted to appropriate datetime and numeric types before analysis.

3.Significant missing values present

Several columns have missing values, notably in fields like Customer Name, Country, Region, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, and Order Priority.

This indicates a need for data cleaning or imputation before performing accurate analytics.

4.Column naming issue

Columns are labeled as Unnamed: 0, Unnamed: 1, etc., suggesting improper header extraction during data import.

Meaningful column names should be assigned to improve readability and usability for analysis.

These observations highlight that data preprocessing is essential before proceeding with deeper analytics or modeling.
